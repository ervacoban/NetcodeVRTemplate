# Netcode VR Template

This is a template project to demonstrate how you can use Netcode together with XR Interaction Toolkit in Unity, so that you can build a VR Multiplayer project.<br><br>
This project also shows how you can spawn and transfer ownership across clients for network objects.

- Unity Version: 2022.3.10f1
- Netcode: 1.6.0
- XR Interaction Toolkit: 2.5.2

I also used Valem Tutorials "XR Toolkit Hand Presence" package for hand animations.
